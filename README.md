## **Applying Machine Learning to Optimize Airbnb Listings**

Business Case: Can we apply machine learning to optimize our listing for Airbnb across the 4P's of marketing? Namely:

- Place - What would be the best place to have our listing?
- Price - What should be the optimal price to set?
- Product - What features are important to have at a property?
- Promotion - How do we advertise our listing?

File run order:

1. Cleaning.ipynb
2. NLP.ipynb
3. Modelling.ipynb
4. Analysis.ipynb (for Tableau output)

I used linear regression to predict the base price for a given listing, Tableau visualizations to determine the business case for purchasing a property at a given location, and natural language processing to generate text once the optimal price, location and product has been determined.
